# BookMyBed
This is my first project using a repository. Originally made using Bitbucket to simplify the coding and team work process during the covid times.
# What is this all about?
This project is all about developing practical solutions to real world problems. Taking inspiration from BookMyShow (please don't sue us:) ) me and my friend ythought of developing a quarantine centre management system to help patients during covid 19. This project is designed to first help the user to find a hospital from a database of given hospitals and enter his/her details.
# But what it so unique about all this?
The synopsis might not seem to be unique but this project has been written for excepotional cases that it never breaks. This project also utilises concepts like File handling,MySQL,MySQL + Python and a hell lot of pythonðŸ˜Ž.
# One last thing
One of the main and unique features of this project is the patient id function. The patient id is system assigned and it starts from the last aptient id even if the system is shut down.
